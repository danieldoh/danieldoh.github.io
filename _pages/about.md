I am a Deep Learning researcher specializing in **3D/4D Reconstruction**, with a focus on **Human-Object Interaction** and **4D Scene Editing**.

I am currently pursuing my **M.S. in the [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE)** at **[Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/)**, where I work in the [Convergence Design Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/) under the supervision of **Dr. Karthik Ramani**. I earned my **B.S. in Computer Engineering** at **[Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/)**.

My research interests lie in enable machines to reason about complex, interacting environments with the fidelity of human perception, and in exploring how generative models and neural rendering can enable more interactive, editable, and realistic 3D/4D digital worlds, driving innovation in Robotics, XR, and Digital Twins. My work has been published in **ACM MM**, the **CHI**, and **IEEE TVCG**.
