I am a Deep Learning researcher specializing in **3D/4D Reconstruction**, with a focus on **Human-Object Interaction** and **4D Scene Editing**.

I am currently pursuing my **M.S. in the [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE)** at **[Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/)**, where I work in the [Convergence Design Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/) under the supervision of **Dr. Karthik Ramani**. I earned my **B.S. in Computer Engineering** at **[Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/)**.

My research interests lie in exploring how generative models and neural rendering can enable more interactive, editable, and realistic 3D/4D digital worlds, driving innovation in Robotics, XR, and Digital Twins. My work has been published in **ACM Multimedia (ACM MM)**, the **ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)**, and **IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)**. I am currently leading a **4D Scene Editing project**.
