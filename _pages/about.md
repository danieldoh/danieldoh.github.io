I am a Master's student in the [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). I am a member of the [Convergence Design Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/cdesign/wp/), under the supervision of Dr. Karthik Ramani. I am deep learning researcher with expertise in 3D/4D Reconstruction focusing on Human-Object Interaction and 4D scene editing. I specializes in integrating Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion Models to enhance the quality of 3D object reconstruction, driving innovation in fields such as XR and Digital Twins.
